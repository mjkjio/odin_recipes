Recipes assignment for The Odin Project.

Practicing creating directories and files in the directory. The files are web pages of
a couple of my favorite recipes created using only HTML. 

Practice includes
-unordered lists
-ordered lists
-embedding images
-setting up a new repository
-moving repository to local machine
-how to stage and commit with git


  This lesson has helped me get more familiar with using git, github, and VS Code. I have
  also become quite comfortable with relative links. I still would like to practice that
  more though.
