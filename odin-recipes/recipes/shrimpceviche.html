    <h2><em>Fresh is the key to this delightful appetizer!</em></h2>

    <p>My friends absolutely love it and beg me for the recipe! You can always double it for larger parties--it goes FAST! Serve as a dip with tortilla chips or as a topping on a tostada spread with mayo. The fearless palate might like this with hot sauce.</p>

    <h3>Ingedients</h3>

    <ul>
        <li>1 lb medium shrimp (peeled and deveined"</li>
        <li>1 cup fresh squeezed lime juice</li>

    <h3>Directions</h3>

    <ol>
        <li>Place shrimp in a glass bowl and cover with lime juice to marinate (or 'cook') for at least 1 hour, or until they turn pink and opaque.
