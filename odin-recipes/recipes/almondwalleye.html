    <h2><em>Flavorful recipe for the most popular food fish in the Midwest</em></h2>

    <p>The fish is broiled with a creamy cheese coating for an impressive flavor and texture. Be careful not to overcook the fish.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>

    <ul>
        <li>1 tsp olive oil</li>
        <li>3 cloves garlic (minced)</li>
        <li>1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
        <li>1/4 cup buttery spread, softened</li>
        <li>1/4 cup slivered almonds, crushed</li>
        <li>3 tbs reduced-fat olive oil mayonnaise</li>
        <li>2 tbs bread crumbs</li>
        <li>2 tbs fresh lime juice</li>
        <li>1 tsp old bay</li>
        <li>1/4 tsp dried basil</li>
        <li>1/4 tsp ground black pepper</li>
        <li>1/8 tsp onion powder</li>
        <li>1/8 tsp celery salt</li>
        <li>1 lb walleye fillets</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Directions</h3>

    <ol>
        <li>Set oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source and preheat the oven's broiler. Line a broiling pan with aluminum foil or spray with olive oil cooking spray.</li>
        <li>Heat olive oil in a skillet over medium heat; cook and stir garlic until fragrant, 3 to 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Mix Parmesan cheese, garlic, buttery spread, almonds, mayonnaise, bread crumbs, lemon juice, seafood seasoning, basil, black pepper, onion powder, and celery salt together in a bowl.</li>
        <li>Arrange walleye fillets in a single layer on the prepared pan; cover pan with aluminum foil.</li>
        <li>Broil in the preheated oven for 2 to 3 minutes. Flip fillets, cover pan with aluminum foil, and broil for 2 to 3 more minutes. Remove aluminum foil and cover fillets with Parmesan cheese mixture. Broil in the oven until fish flakes easily with a fork and topping is browned, about 2 more minutes.</li>
    </ol>
